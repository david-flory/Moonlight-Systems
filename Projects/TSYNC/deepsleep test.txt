Output showing TSYNC shortcoming when using deepsleep.
If using deepsleep, you must save the state of the DST flag "dst_check" before hibernation 
and reset it on wake.

Begin demo
Now test DST rollover when time not updated externally

Timestamp now is 31-03-2024 01:59:55

deepsleep for 6 seconds
dst_check is  False, which is correct
*****************************
dst_check is  True
[incorrect, because initialising tsync has set it [correctly] to summertime
because it was summertime when tsync was initialised, so clock not put forward]
Timestamp now is 31-03-2024 02:00:01
*****************************
Set timestamp for just before clocks go back
Timestamp now is 27-10-2024 01:59:55

dst_check is  True
deepsleep for 6 seconds
***************************
dst_check is  False
[reset to false because of initialisation during winter time]
Timestamp now is 27-10-2024 02:00:01

If we save the state of 'clk.dst_check' before deepsleep and set it on wake.

Begin demo
Now test DST rollover when time not updated externally

Timestamp before clocks go forward  is 31-03-2024 01:59:55

dst_check is  False [correct, we are on winter time]
Deepleep for 5 seconds
***************************
dst_check is  False [as flag was saved, clock is put forward]
Timestamp now is 31-03-2024 03:00:01

Set timestamp for just before clocks go back
Timestamp now is 27-10-2024 01:59:55

dst_check is  True
deepleep for 5 seconds
***************************
dst_check is  True [as flag was saved, clock is put back correctly]
Timestamp now is 27-10-2024 01:00:01
