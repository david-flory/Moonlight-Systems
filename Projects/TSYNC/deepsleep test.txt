deepsleep for 6 seconds
dst_check is  False, which is correct
*****************************
dst_check is  True
[incorrect, because initialising tsync has set it [correctly] to summertime
because it was summertime when tsync was initialised, so clock not put forward]

Set timestamp for just before clocks go back

dst_check is  False
[reset to false because of initialisation during winter time]

If we save the state of 'clk.dst_check' before deepsleep and set it on wake.
