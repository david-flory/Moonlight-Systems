TSYNC.py is a Micro Python class object providing functions to update and maintain the Real Time Clock for the ESP32 family of development boards.
TSYNC can update the RTC from either an NTP server or GPS module, and provide timestmps in a user configurable format for any location in the world.
TSYNC will also update the RTC as nescessary for countries where daylight saving time is used.
